## The Odin Project - Project: HTML/CSS (Easy)

This was great for a first project. Although I took longer than I would've liked, I'd like to say it was fairly easy.

There are still a few things that I'd like to come back and fix in order to have a responsive design by throwing in some media queries and minimum widths to stop elements from overlapping each other but will be doing so at a later date.

Next task is to tackle the difficult version.
